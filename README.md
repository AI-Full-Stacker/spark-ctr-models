# Spark-ctr-models
CTR prediction models based on spark. Easy to use and we realized most common models for CTR prediction. The most difference is that we not only implement model trainsï¼Œbut also make it easy to deploy to the Online Server with Java interface.

The main algorithms we realized:

- [x] LR

- [x] FM

- [x] XGBoost

- [x] XGBoostLR

- [x] XGBoostFM

# 1. java
Java interfaces mainly used for parse and deploy the models trained by spark platform to the Online Server.

# 2. scala
Scala module trained models and save them as a specific format which java interface can parse them for predict in Online Server.

# 3. Feature Engineering

- [x] FeatureMaker:
- [x] SparseVector:
