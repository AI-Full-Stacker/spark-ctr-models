# spark-ctr-models
CTR prediction models based on spark. Easy to use and we realized most common models for CTR prediction. The most difference is that we not only implement model trainsï¼Œbut also make it easy to deploy to the Online Server with Java interface.

The main algorithms we realized

1. LR

2. FM

3. XGBoost

4. XGBoostLR

3. XGBoostFM

# 1. java
Java interfaces mainly used for parse and deploy the models trained by spark platform to the Online Server.

# 2. scala
Scala module trained models and save them as a specific format.
